## About the project
### What is ehotel buffet?
Ehotel buffet was a task during my studies at Codecool. This project is a simulation of a hotel's breakfast buffet. It helps you to develop and optimise the logic behind how to run a breakfast buffet effectively. <br>
During development I tried to achieve two goals:
<ol>
  <li>
    Minimize dissatisfaction by avoiding empty plates in the buffet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Minimize food waste.
  </li>
</ol>

The EHotel Buffet Management System is built to streamline the breakfast buffet service in a hotel during a specified season. It takes into account various guest types (e.g., Business, Tourist, Kids) and their meal preferences to ensure that the buffet serves a variety of meals that cater to guest needs.

### Features
<ul>
  <li>Efficiently manages breakfast buffet service for different guest types.</li>
  <li>Allocates meals based on guest preferences and remaining cycles.</li>
  <li>Minimizes food waste and costs.</li>
  <li>Generates reports on unhappy guests and food wastage.</li>
</ul>
